        <h1 class="titlepost">Habits pt. 1: Breaking Bad</h1>
        <p style="color:grey" class="content" id="subtitle">By Zeaus Koh · 7 min read<br>12 July 2023</p>
        <p class="content">I just reviewed my goals for Quarter 3, and with one recent insight from Sahil Bloom and James Clear about habits compounding.</p>
        <p class="content">As apt as it is, I'm currently learning Calculus. James Clear talks about the importance of continuous improvement <a href="https://jamesclear.com/continuous-improvement." target="_blank">here</a>. The power of tiny gains is real!</p>
        <p class="content">So I thought about writing down the positive habits I’ve been struggling with or planning to implement in my life and the negative habits I want to break. More importantly, writing down my plans and sharing them with my friends will help keep me on track.</p>
        <p class="content">Now let’s look at the bad habits I want to break. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/5CM4UuQ9Gnd6K2YyKGPMoK?si=aOa87hsgQXyo8nIulTMt-w" target="_blank">Steve Lacy starts playing</a>. Underneath each Bad Habit (baddy), I’ve included my specific line of action I will take. Friends, if I’m not on track, call me out.</p>
        <h2 class="content">Baddy 1: Minute Tardiness</h2>
        <p class="content">I’m sometimes late for meetings/outings by minutes. This is often due to leaving the house at the bare latest needed to reach on time. And Google Maps is actually not very good at estimating time taken for a commute.</p>
        <p class="content">Solution:</p>
        <ul class="content">
        <li>Add 10 minutes to the Google Maps timing i.e. leave 10 minutes earlier than the bare latest.</li>
        <li>I often delay because I’m trying to get work done and don’t want to break my flow. The solution? Start work much earlier, don’t leave it to the last moment before I’m going to leave to start.</li>
        <li>Basically, whenever I’ve to go somewhere that day, I must start my tasks for that day in advance as well as allocate time afterwards to do them.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2 class="content">Baddy 2: Unable to plan and schedule time effectively</h2>
        <p class="content">This is a biggie. The way I see it: focused action is good, generic business is bad. If I can clearly delineate my schedule, prevent my different projects and commitments from overlapping, I believe I can 10x my quality of life and mental wellbeing.</p>
        <p class="content">I also think there’ll be a positive benefit to my work as well. As it is, I’ve quite a number of commitments: schoolwork, CCA (though it is toning down and a lot of my other stuff take over), project work, science projects etc. But they often overlap, and leave me struggling for breath.</p>
        <p class="content">Solution:</p>
        <ul class="content">
        <li>Cut down. Cut down. Cut down. Delete. Delete. Delete. Delegate. Delegate. Delegate. A simple litmus test I do everyday in my journaling: “If I repeat this day for 100 days, would my life be better or worse?” I can simplify this for every project I take on: “If I do this project for a month, will it improve or hurt my life?”</li>
        <li>Maximise an efficient workload and task management system. Integrate these into a system: Google Calendar, daily planner, physical calendar and whiteboard. Spend 30 mins every Sunday morning to plan the week on Google Calendar. Translate major events onto my physical calendar ANd whiteboard. Update my daily planner every night before bed during MHHH.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2 class="content">Baddy 3: Saying things without thinking</h2>
        <p class="content">Things I should think twice before saying: unverified ideas, secrets people have entrusted me with, and ideas that don’t contribute (i.e. no value-add to anyone).</p>
        <p class="content">Solution:</p>
        <ul class="content">
        <li>Pause 3 seconds before replying to anybody in a conversation.</li>
        <li>I’ve also come up with a framework for avoiding gossip: Is it true? Is it right? Is it helpful? Only if yes to all three questions should I listen to something. This applies to what I say as well, since conversations go both ways.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2 class="content">Baddy 4: Engaging in bullshit arguments, activities and tasks</h2>
        <p class="content">This is a horrible habit I have. I often find myself dealing with bullshit. Bullshit are things that don’t add value, but take away value in a slow, unapparent manner. They include unnecessary arguments with people about things that really don’t matter (e.g. arguing about whose political party is the best), (mostly hedonistic) activities that provide a short dopamine release but no actual value (e.g. watching YouTube, reading lousy manga, spending too much time on WhatsApp, eating lousy and unhealthy snacks), and doing tasks that are redundant or useless (e.g. checking Gmail inboxes).</p>
        <p class="content">Solution:</p>
        <ul class="content">
        <li>No bullshit mentality. It all starts from the mindset. If you make bullshit a big no-no, you won’t attract nor engage in bullshit.</li>
        <li>Remove sources of bullshit. Some sources can be removed e.g. people with bad vibes and give lots of bs. Some sources, however, are harder to remove, such as apps like WhatsApp.</li>
        <li>For those things, it involves changing the root relationship with said sources of bs. Again, it’s all about the mentality. It’s like discipline, but for a good motivator i.e. to get rid of bs. This was how I overcame my YouTube addiction.</li>
        <li>In the end, zoom out. The value of bullshit diminishes when you look at a 1-2 week timeframe, and it completely vanishes when you look at a 1 month timeframe. So just keep that macro level view about me.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2 class="content">Baddy 5: Not using digital devices productively</h2>
        <p class="content">Okay this is a continuation of the previous bad habit. My screen time on my phone is about 5 hours a day, which is crazy considering I’m awake 15 hours or so a day. That’s like ⅓ of my day on a phone?! And it’s mostly bullshit. Recently I’ve been addicted to Webtoon, again, a bad source of distraction and bs. Or having to content with an endless list of asks on WhatsApp.</p>
        <p class="content">Solution:</p>
        <ul class="content">
        <li>I like to simplify it down to my favourite phrase: change or accept. I don’t accept that I cannot use digital devices productively, because deep down I know I can. So my other choice is to change it. Fundamentally. If I can break my YouTube addiction entirely, I can overcome digital distractions too.</li>
        <li>One simple method is to clear my tabs at the end of the day. I’m still trying this out, but I’ll see how it goes.</li>
        <li>Another is just simply the value of foresight and hindsight. If I zoom out, does reading this Webtoon really matter? Probably not. Pretend I’m a reader reading the Manga of Zeaus and I see me (the mc) wasting time on manga. I’d probably know it’s bad. So once I remove myself from my internal monkey mind and take a step outside from another perspective, perhaps it’ll be better to overcome my distractions.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2 class="content">Baddy 6: Inconsistent health systems</h2>
        <p class="content">This just means: inconsistent sleep schedule, inconsistent diet, inconsistent workout and exercise schedule, and inconsistent wellbeing practices.</p>
        <p class="content">Solution:</p>
        <ul class="content">
        <li>Sleep at 930 pm every night. Wake up at 630 am. On weekends, I can wake up at 830 am. Follow the 7-3-2-1 rule (later).</li>
        <li>Eat smaller, more frequent and healthier meals throughout the day. Three cups of milk or more daily. In the school canteen, only order Caifan, Japanese Donburi or a non-fried, low-fat option. NO sweet drinks.</li>
        <li>Don’t slack off, for even a day, on workouts. ALWAYS make sure I get in a 30 minute cardio + callisthenics + swim session every evening. Switch to mornings on weekends.</li>
        <li>Follow a consistent MHHH system every night (in the next post).</li>
        </ul>
        <h2 class="content">Baddy 7: Inconsistent work ethic</h2>
        <p class="content">I’ve a lot on my plate: schoolwork, Project Cratos, CCA (twice a week), planning a MUN, my AI project, my marine bio research attachment, test revision, and my personal skills development.</p>
        <p class="content">Truth is, it’s more than most people can handle. I suspect those who do “more” than 7-8 big commitments aren’t coping, they’re just getting by. I don’t know when “busy” became a social status sort of thing here in my school, but people sure as heck delude themselves into thinking that their busyness is a sign that they’re in some way, good.</p>
        <p class="content">The problem becomes apparent when you take a closer look. You’d see something called “inconsistency”: overcommitted folks can really only take on one or two things at a time, so the other commitments just get left on the backburner. That means, they don’t care about things until it gets so dire they need to care about it.</p>
        <p class="content">Though I’ve come some way from Sec 3 me, I do see such an inconsistent work ethic in myself. I hate to admit it but it’s true.</p>
        <p class="content">Solution:</p>
        <ul class="content">
        <li>Make 110% a norm. This will be talked about in the next part of the post but it means translating all received inputs (goals) to 110% more demanding goals, and then using the newly defined goals as a metric for success. If someone tells me to do a proposal by next Thursday, I’d do two proposals by next Tuesday.</li>
        <li>Delegate to people who are able to, willing and capable of doing good work. Help them at something I enjoy and am good at in return.</li>
        <li>Communicate. Let people know when I’m busy. I should make this a basic expectation of myself from now on.</li>
        </ul>
        <hr>
        <p class="content">These are a list of the bad habits I will break. I am making this post so my friends can keep me accountable. I will do another post (part 2) about the good habits I’m working to implement in the meantime. Cheers.</p>
