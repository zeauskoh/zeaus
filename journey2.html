        <h1 class="titlepost">going cold turkey on digital entertainment</h1>

        <div class="content">
          <p>im proud of myself. there's one incredibly difficult task i've committed my holidays to doing, and that's breaking free from the Attention Economy. what's that? it's how there are thousands of top-notch high-calibre engineers and coders and psychologists economically incentivised to make you addicted to YouTube/Twitter/Instagram/Snapchat/WhatsApp/any games...</p>
          <p>for me personally i quit instagram and took down all my accounts from the Net sometime in Feb/March 2023? i can't remember but i saw the difference for sure. completely no FOMO (i realised instagram made me care a lot about people i dont care about, if that makes sense), more focus, more deep work, less distractions, prioritising irl relationships over shallow social media augmented ones, the list goes on.</p>
          <p>but i had another problem, my screen time on my phone was around 5-6 hours a day! that's insane. what was i spending all my time on? i did a meta experiment where i looked at HOW i spent my time on my phone, the findings:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>50% of that time on WhatsApp? ok but that's really true because i sometimes get carried away in whatsapp convos</li>
            <li>40% of the time on YouTube!! omg so that was where all my time had gone?! i was ADDICTED.</li>
            <li>10% on reading, but bruh i could barely stay focused on 10-20 pages before going to youtube</li>
          </ul>
          <p>so that was the problem! okay, so the solution was glaringly obvious? quit youtube, completely. heh, easier said than done.</p>
          <p>i kept relapsing, kept finding myself instinctively typing in https.youtu.be into my browser. then i came across a brilliant podcast episode on The Knowledge Project talking about the Science of Addiction, with Dr Anna Lembke on Pain and Pleasure. it really helped me to understand how addiction cycles are enabled, how difficult and unhealthy and diseased it can be, and how to overcome it.</p>
          <p>in summary, the addiction cycle comes from <strong>dopamine</strong>, really every single human addiction is driven by a hedonistic desire for pleasure, and this pleasure is really just enabled by the release of a neurotransmitter, dopamine. alcoholism, smoking, gaming addiction, porn addiction, are all because of people's need for pleasure (and thus dopamine). when we consume such content, it may give us an initial dopamine surge. amd after there is a dopamine surge, our body rushes to return to setpoint. unfortunately this process is not precise, and in returning to setpoint it tips the scale over from pleasure to pain, so the neurotransmitters for pain activate -- we feel like shit without the consumption of the Thing. so we consume it again, the dopamine surges, we feel happy. leave it, we feel pain. the cycle persists.</p>
          <p>interestingly, the MORE we consume the thing, the less unit dopamine we get. basically the less happy we feel each time we use the thing. sure we feel happiER, but the unit increase in happiness (ik i shouldn't be quantifying smth so abstract but bear with me) is SMALLER. but the moment u leave the thing, the unit increase in PAIN is BIGGER. it's a habitual cycle that spirals negatively! and one more thing, just SEEING the stimulus already triggers a mini-high in your brain i.e. you get a tiny dopamine surge. if you're a porn addict, and i show u the pornhub logo, u get a dopamine surge. JUST BY LOOKING AT THE LOGO. ur brain imagines what u can experience if u click on it, so it's like ur brain salivating</p>
          <p>so we now established that pain and pleasure are linked in a habitual cycle, like yin and yang. i've checked out dr lembke's credentials and i trust her sharing about addiction (it is only a COINCIDENCE she's a stanford uni faculty member, im very unbiased). but that means anything that gives us pleasure would yield a similar result. WHICH ALSO MEANS we can create good habits, by finding pleasure in beneficial tasks. this for me is reading and writing. i have rediscovered a love for all kinds of books during the June hols, really anything that intrigues me/makes me curious i enjoy reading bc i learn smth (currently reading Navalmanack). so u can create GOOD HABITS as easy as BAD HABITS! eureka.</p>
          <p>overcoming the YouTube addiction cycle became much more obvious and easy for me after this realisation. in fact it was so simple i can't believe i took so long to break my addiction. here's a note of what i did in case i ever find myself in need of breaking out of a habit in the future, i hope this helps you too:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>i kept trying to do it hardcore, i.e. going cold turkey, i highly recommend this</li>
            <li>anddd i kept relapsing, maybe i'd last for a day without youtube and i'd relapse the next day the moment i'm unawares, or 2 days. no biggie, keep doing it. try to scale it healthily: 1 day, then 3 days, then 5 days, then a week</li>
            <li>occupy that time with MEANINGFUL pursuits. one thing that rly helped me through getting out of my youtube addiction was focusing on cool shit like training my own AI, learning full stack webdev, reading books like Smart Brevity</li>
            <li>all around i was CHANGING my lifestyle, focusing on fitness, having a productive and balanced day-to-day schedule, leaving no time for frivolous distractions like youtube</li>
            <li>after a while i stopped instinctively reaching for youtube, in fact i focused on stuff like the above and talking to my friends irl (social relationships are impt)</li>
            <li>over time, i completely did not see the joy in using youtube for entertainment, i realised at this point i LOST the dopamine surge connected with using youtube -- i was free!</li>
            <li>interestingly, i could use youtube for research on AI or learning about calculus but i'd never once get sidetracked, for some reason some transformation in brain chemistry must have happened and i believe the above steps helped in one way or another (i would repeat this experiment to find out exactly which step empirically helped me to get out of my youtube addiction but i dont have any other bad addictions :)</li>
          </ol>
          <p>and that's it. i don't use instagram anymore, don't watch youtube for entertainment, only use WhatsApp for high-value convos (i adopt 2 rules for determining this: Pareto principle + "Make Every Word Count"), use Apple Books a lot (im a hardcore libgen.rs user)</p>
          <p>at the same time i've also deleted all my public profile pics for thing like Tele or WhatsApp cos i dont see the need for a pfp; pretty symbolic of a breaking free from the attention economy LOL</p>
          <p>great milestone for this journey, can't wait for more. ðŸ†™ ðŸ†™ ðŸ†™</p>
