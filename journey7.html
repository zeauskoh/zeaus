        <h1 class="titlepost">Q3 2023 Checkpoint: Ups, Downs and Syndromes</h1>
        <p style="color:grey" class="content" id="subtitle">By Zeaus Koh · 7 min read<br>23 August 2023</p>
        <p class="content">I’ve been so very slow in updating on my self-improvement journey, but rest assured I’ve been doing daily journaling (not so consistently 😢😢). I thought by writing this I might be able to consolidate some big pointers I’ve picked up and set some new goals moving forward into Q4 of 2023… Leggo!</p>
        <p class="content">Term 3 was hectic to say the least, and when we do so many things so fast, we might forget to pause and step back and reassess. So I’ll start off with some things, people and moments I’m grateful for:</p>
        <ul class="content">
          <li>Family - ily all :)</li>
          <li>Taden Jee - I’m so glad to have met you since s1 and you’re one of the most solid, inspiring people in my life. It’s rare I find someone who operates on the same wavelength, frequency and mental models as I do. We’ve grown so much over the past 4 years and even without coordination it seems like our phases and plans in life overlap and I’m so so grateful to have you by my side. I love you.</li>
          <li>Yiwei - I am NOT okay with the hair insults. I hate the haircut more than you do. But thanks for many deep conversations and LIGHTHEARTED (tankinlian reference for ur slow mind) jokes. Thank you for motivating me to be more dutiful in my acads and for helping me in physics even though I take 20 minutes to understand turning effects of forces. I love you.</li>
          <li>Alas - This term I’m happy to be the one providing a shoulder to lean on and support you through tough times. I can call you a best friend because we think of the same things at the same time and wear the same shirts without coordination. Telepathy is real with this one. I love you.</li>
          <li>Ema - U know I can’t leave my big buff Asian man hanging, so here’s one for u. You are very reliable and I’m glad I’ve converted you into a Naval fan. If you internalise the wisdom you’ll win the game of life, so get off YouTube and start grinding with me. I love you.</li>
          <li>The hapfam (the romanian, the stoic, the downie, the pig, the airport runway head, the 25 year old man) - thanks for sticking with me especially when i rant about pw. I enjoy spending time with yall. i love you guys. may these friendships last a lifetime.</li>
          <li>Big Sis - ur a busy woman now flying the singapore flag high in all ur comps. I’m so proud of what you’ve achieved, it motivates me to do better. After all we’re only 2 months apart in age. May we actually get to the singapore river run i’ve been reminding you for for about 2 weeks now. Jiayouz and ily.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="content">There’s so many others who I’ve learnt from and have helped me in the past few weeks. Kang you, kyler, dion, asher, chenggu, raisin, yichen, siqi, wugway, kaikeat… </p>
        <p class="content">Wow, typing all of that has really put me into a positive frame of mind. The main theme for this term was to be INTENSITY. But over the weeks I’ve shifted it to INTENSITY and SYSTEMS. Because in a high level meta-sense, only with good systems will intensity produce effective results, if that even makes sense.</p>
        <h1 class="content">Inertia</h1>
        <p class="content">This is real. When it comes to getting painful shit done, things like writing PW proposals or getting my Maths paper done, it’s very hard to get started. There’s this activation energy that needs to be overcome and the only true way to do so is to just start. Lol.</p>
        <p class="content">I just tell myself “Let’s do this for 30 seconds”. And usually that’s all it takes to get some inertia on your side and now it’s hard to stop. Works 90% of the time.</p>
        <h1 class="content">Consistency Compounds</h1>
        <p class="content">Getting our heads around nonlinearity is very important. School systems tend to reinforce this idea of linearity: an increase in x produces a relative increase/decrease in y. But in reality for most things that matter (fitness, knowledge, business, side projects, sports) it’s very variable.</p>
        <p class="content">But consistency means that progress is exponential. And right now, I find it tough because I’m in the first part of the exponential curve, progress is slow. I stare into the mirror and I don’t see much change. My AI project is not producing the results I want. My coding projects stall because I reach a roadblock in my learning path. I’m taking too long to ship my ideas.</p>
        <p class="content">And it sucks. So I keep having to remind myself of this exponential curve. I draw a big e^x graph and smack it on my whiteboard. Right now I probably will only see marginal results, so I gotta grind through the current periods of slow growth. I cannot wait for the day the results show up, and it starts compounding rapidly. I’d estimate it’ll only really show after the EOY exam season. In the meantime, I just keep grinding.</p>
        <p class="content">I try my best to follow the habits <a href="https://zeauskoh.github.io/zeaus/journey6.html" target="_blank">here</a>. And it’s easier over time, after a while it’s just a normal part of my lifestyle I don’t think too much of it. Which is great, frees up my mind to think of new ideas.</p>
        <h1 class="content">Side Projects</h1>
        <p class="content">This is a real toughie. I love doing side projects because 1) I can treat it as a hobby and so if I don’t get immediate results, the cost is less, 2) it’s interesting and 3) it’s fun.</p>
        <p class="content">Right now I’m working on an AI project. I promised myself to release it so long ago but I severely underestimated the difficulty in machine learning progression. Overconfidence of the amateur, I guess.</p>
        <p class="content">But I noticed doing these projects gave me the most energy, so I try to keep it going even with a lot of school stuff. And the issue is when I do these side projects I prefer doing it in big chunks of time. So 30-min slots just won’t cut it, I need 2-hour deep work sessions to produce something of result. Much like Paul Graham’s Maker Schedule vs Manager Schedule.</p>
        <p class="content">This is something I’d appreciate advice on, if anyone had any to offer.</p>
        <h1 class="content">Doing the Minimum</h1>
        <p class="content">There’s this theory called regression to the mean, which states every high will be inevitably followed by some form of decrease to the average level. And so no matter how well I want to do certain non-”work” stuff, there’s still the basic level I gotta hit.</p>
        <p class="content">This includes but isn’t limited to: homework, studying for EOYs, project work (it’s over now thankfully). And these already require so much time and effort.</p>
        <p class="content">I guess priorities matter. There’s no way about it. I keep a timer <a href="https://www.tickcounter.com/countdown/4349235/countdown-to-end-of-sec-4-exams" target="_blank">here</a> counting down the days till the end of O level chinese. But until then, I’ll make doing well for Sec 4 promos the priority.</p>
        <p class="content">Fitness comes next. Then one or two side projects. Then sailing.</p>
        <h1 class="content">Learning from Setbacks</h1>
        <p class="content">I think schoolwise, it was kinda average. An A2 for CSC and Social Studies and a B3 for Maths. Absolute dogshit mediocre. But hey that just means more things to work on, especially for maths. Time to grit my teeth and double down on it.</p>
        <p class="content">Also set up a prep schedule for EOYs and it’s been going relatively ok. Finished a lot of homework projects ahead of schedule which does help a lot.</p>
        <p class="content">Other than that project work was a horror movie on drugs. It’s pulling to a close so that’s that. But I learnt how to lead better, how to set a vision and keep to it, and the importance of choosing the right team members. Also important to choose a project based on interest and passion, not just to tick a box. Box tickers are sheep.</p>
        <h1 class="content">Now, goals.</h1>
        <p class="content">Alright this is the fun part. I had a really fun conversation with taden today and I think it’s time to redefine and set new goals. I’ll keep some more personal ones private, rebuilding in stealth 🤭💀 Truly embodying the monk mode hehe.</p>
        <ul class="content">
          <li>[redacted]</li>
          <li>[redacted]</li>
          <li>[redacted]</li>
          <li>[redacted]</li>
          <li>[redacted]</li>
          <li>[redacted]</li>
          <li>[redacted]</li>
          <li>[redacted]</li>
          <li>[redacted]</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="content">I actually wrote these goals out but redacted them here. If you’re curious I’m happy to share more personally but it just occurred to me that a website means anyone on the Internet can access it and I don’t have any security for my website. This whole thing is still run on html, css and a little bit of js. Which reminds me, I need to learn SQL and js frameworks asap before my github files crash and burn and die.</p>
        <p class="content">To summarise Term 3, I will choose <strong>Tiny Steps</strong>. I’ve gotten the mindset down, gotten the principles down, getting habits in place (though it’s a work in progress and it’s far from perfect). I’m excited to see what the next few months bring. No let me correct that: I’m excited to bring my plans into reality in the next few months.</p>
        <p class="content">Cheers and if you stayed till the end, I love you very much it means a lot to me you’re reading this. <3</p>
