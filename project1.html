        <p class="content">tldr; i learnt webdev in order to build my website. i rate it a solid 8 out of 10.</p>
        <p class="content>i got inspired when i saw some cool teens based in Canada making their own websites and publishing their essays/cool ideas online for their friends to see, thought it'd be cool if i replicate this.</p>
        <p class="content>basically i learnt html, css and js to build a core website. to build my website i wanted it to take on a blog format, so i could publish new posts, but alas to do a blog u need something called a CMS - content management system. for now, i hard code every new page on this site :)</p>
        <p class="content>i consulted chatgpt a lot but i've learnt a ton too. pretty fun; my main resources were VSCode, W3Schools, GitHub, and YouTube tutorials.</p>
