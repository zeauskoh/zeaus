        <h1 class="titlepost">My thoughts on School</h1>
        <p style="color:grey" class="content" id="subtitle">By Zeaus Koh ¬∑ 5 min read<br>12 July 2023</p>
        <p class="content">So some people have been telling me I‚Äôve <strong>changed</strong>. That‚Äôs interesting. I appreciate directness in conversations, so my reply would be an emphatic nod and a ‚ÄúPlease go on‚Äù.</p>
        <p class="content">I love hearing feedback from people I trust. Sometimes all you need is for someone to hold a mirror up to your face before you can see what‚Äôs wrong (or right). Such conversations of a similar thread have been a recurrent theme since March 2023. I can think of Ë∞¢ËÄÅÂ∏à, ÊàøËÄÅÂ∏à, Yichen, Alas‚Ä¶ Sometimes I confide and ask for advice. Thank you to jaden, ryan, yiwei, wayne.</p>
        <p class="content">There‚Äôs a long answer and a short answer. I always prefer the short answer. Well, yes, I think I‚Äôve undergone quite a big character change since the end of 2022. The change was initially unhealthy and harmful at the beginning of 2023, but over the course of April to June I‚Äôve been working on myself and I‚Äôm reasonably confident insofar that I‚Äôve made progress, good progress. In the direction I think is best.</p>
        <p class="content">In 2022, I was a real tryhard. I was trying to excel in so many areas in school. Grades were very, very important to me. So were my extracurriculars. Student council, despite the difficulties I experienced, was a priority. Trying to be friends with everybody. Model UN üòÇ. Science competitions. I‚Äôll not be able to finish this post tonight if I go on.</p>
        <p class="content">At the end of 2022, when I got news of my rejection, I was devastated. Looking back now with a standpoint of clarity, I can‚Äôt help but cringe.</p>
        <p class="content">It really toppled my fragile sense of self-worth. And that negative vicious cycle persisted through the start of 2023. I lost a lot of motivation in school. I was self-pitying. I was victimising. My schoolwork quality dropped. Participation in lessons dipped. Overall, I fell off.</p>
        <p class="content">Strangely, it was like I was playing a video game from spectator mode. I could see the problems. But I didn‚Äôt act to correct them.</p>
        <p class="content">That continued till April-May (Term 2). I improved slightly after some pep talks with my homies and my teachers. And I was slowly rebuilding my identity up from a more stable footing, in principles. (I will probably write a post about the key principles I now lead my life by soon.)</p>
        <p class="content">June Holidays were a big respite. I could take 3 weeks off from school and really just relax, recuperate, do some sports I loved and reflect. Coming back to Term 3, I had a fresh mind, a clean slate, positive energy and an ambition to make a comeback. In fact, my homies have said I am doing better overall now.</p>
        <p class="content">But, I have to admit: It ain‚Äôt easy. Separating my self-worth from school achievements also came in a bundle deal with not seeing the value in school.</p>
        <p class="content">I‚Äôve asked around, this isn‚Äôt exactly an uncommon line of thinking. Perhaps the motivations may differ from person to person. I notice it is the most outstanding, highest potential students who may burn out and develop some internal resentment and question ‚ÄúWhy school‚Äù.</p>
        <p class="content">I don‚Äôt claim to have found a good answer. Heck, I‚Äôm pretty sure this isn‚Äôt a good answer. But it is MY answer to the most annoying question any teacher can expect to hear: ‚ÄúWhy do we have to come to school?‚Äù</p>
        <p class="content">I think by penning it down in a website post not only can I demonstrate my progress but I can also consolidate my thoughts and build resolve.</p>
        <p class="content">This is an ever-growing, ever-changing list of tenets I set for myself so I come to school with the right mindset, and make the best use of school in the way that aligns with my goals. For my friends reading this, some of these may work for you, some won‚Äôt. That‚Äôs ok.</p>
        <h2 class="content">1. Good grades isn‚Äôt a marker of intelligence, it‚Äôs a sign you can do hard things.</h2>
        <p class="content">The obsession with grades isn‚Äôt the problem, it‚Äôs just a symptom of students not knowing what they really want. Which is okay. Since we are all high school students and having everything planned out is downright strange and unideal.</p>
        <p class="content">The first step is separating an A1 from smart. I absolutely hate it when I hear peers use ‚Äúintelligence‚Äù as an excuse or reason for anything. I acknowledge and it is true, intelligence plays a part. I see intelligence as being able to 1) pick up knowledge fast, and 2) connect the dots between pieces of information at scale.</p>
        <p class="content">If your quotient in these 2 areas is high, of course you‚Äôre going to do, on average, better. But, grades and tests and EOYs aren‚Äôt a metric for intelligence.</p>
        <p class="content">In fact, I need to unlearn my relationship with tests. See it for what it is: a way to evaluate my understanding of syllabus knowledge and construction of mental models.</p>
        <p class="content">The grades do matter. But not as a sign of intelligence. Instead, good grades show something better: you can do HARD THINGS.</p>
        <p class="content">Hard things are good. This is a growth mindset. Shy away from difficult things and you lose out in the long run. Keeping yourself out of your comfort zone is the easiest way to learn to do hard things well.</p>
        <p class="content">In the end, if I get an A1 for my Integrated Maths common test, it‚Äôs not because I‚Äôm smart. It‚Äôs because I sat down for a couple of hours, consolidated notes, reviewed my textbook and did practise worksheets. I did something hard. If I mastered calculus, I MASTERED calculus. It was difficult, and I did it. That‚Äôs what matters.</p>
        <p class="content">The question is: Can you do hard things? Or do you want to find the shortest shortcut to get a number on a piece of paper of which the value diminishes increasingly over time?</p>
        <h2 class="content">2. You don‚Äôt really need the knowledge, it‚Äôs the mental models you build that counts.</h2>
        <p class="content">Next thing I catch myself and my peers asking often is: ‚ÄúWhen will I ever use <insert specific, niche subject knowledge> when I go out into the real world?‚Äù</p>
        <p class="content">Haha, let‚Äôs BeReal. In most cases you won‚Äôt need to know that secant is the inverse of a cosine function to do your job well. Or you don't need the definition of homeostasis as the maintenance of a constant internal environment.</p>
        <p class="content">Then why do these things matter? I have spent some time mulling this over and with credits to Farnum Street https://fs.blog/mental-models/, I have an answer.</p>
        <p class="content">It‚Äôs not the specific knowledge we learn, it‚Äôs the mental models we build in the process. Mental models are a base collection of related principles to understand a specific facet of the world. This is my own understanding of mental models. If you don‚Äôt get it, check out FS.</p>
        <p class="content">For example, while I don‚Äôt specifically need to know how to differentiate trigonometric functions, the Mental Model of Calculus is still fundamental. It‚Äôs about understanding rates of change. That mental model can be applied to look at data in any domain from a mathematical viewpoint, whether you‚Äôre a sales manager looking at your Q3 revenue or a writer monitoring the sales of his latest novel.</p>
        <p class="content">Once I understood this, I stopped doubting the validity of the subjects I learn. Come on, our teachers, especially the SMTP teachers, are really unironically very smart. Many have PhDs. They‚Äôre not trying to force knowledge onto us.</p>
        <p class="content">Instead, see it as a significant addition to your mental toolbox. For all you know, a Mental Model of Homeostasis can be applied to maintaining a positive culture in your company.</p>
        <h2 class="content">3. From a pragmatic standpoint, a stellar high school portfolio is still a college applications green flag.</h2>
        <p class="content">Let‚Äôs get real. High school is often seen as an audition for college. A transition phase. I don‚Äôt entirely agree, but I believe high school credentials are very important to a college applications process.</p>
        <p class="content">That‚Äôs why I still work on my grades, doing the best I can to polish up my scores. I go for external competitions in the sciences and take part in MUNs here and there. Plan and organise large-scale, some international, events. I was in the student council.</p>
        <p class="content">By doing this I could ensure my portfolio looked somewhat decent. It‚Äôs not at the stage I want it to be just yet, but in due time I‚Äôm going to get it to the level I want.</p>
        <p class="content">This way I can focus on my longer-term goals, such as the college I want to study in after NS.</p>
        <h2 class="content">4. Beta-testing and growth is easy.</h2>
        <p class="content">Another pragmatic way of looking at school is: It‚Äôs like a sterile nutrient-rich agar plate for growth. Teachers are paid to help you learn. The school environment is to a certain extent focused on learning and education. Everyone is working to improve.</p>
        <p class="content">It is in some ways a positive environment where you can try, fail, try again and grow. It‚Äôs a beta-testing sandbox. Any errors made can be worked on, your flaws sharpened into strengths. Growth supercharged.</p>
        <p class="content">I‚Äôve made tons of mistakes in high school. Done some really stupid things. Failed in some aspects. But in school I‚Äôve been able to be taught by my mentors and more outstanding peers.</p>
        <p class="content">I have seen character growth since Secondary 1. And it has not yet stopped. Where else would anybody care so much about helping you improve?</p>
        <h2 class="content">5. Don‚Äôt be the Same Part 1: Avoid and avoid becoming the mediocre</h2>
        <p class="content">A caveat I keep in mind now when it comes to school can be summarised down to ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt be the Same‚Äù. I want to be outstanding in some way. There are two main pitfalls I must avoid. The first is being mediocre.</p>
        <p class="content">There‚Äôs a difference from being dumb/inexperienced. When I start out anything, I love to ask stupid questions. I don‚Äôt care if it makes me look stupid, because I can 10x my growth that way.</p>
        <p class="content">In high school, staying mediocre is a pitfall to avoid. I don‚Äôt want to give up and lie flat and expect myself to succeed. Complete bullshit.</p>
        <p class="content">I run towards hard things, try new sports, try new things. If I fail I get back up.</p>
        <p class="content">In other words, work my butt off. This way you will never be mediocre. Trust, there‚Äôs really no way you can give your 110% and be bad. Not possible. Anything else is an excuse.</p>
        <h2 class="content">6. Don‚Äôt be the Same Part 2: Avoid the chosen-path fallacy</h2>
        <p class="content">The second pitfall is to avoid the chosen-path fallacy. I don‚Äôt think this is an established cognitive bias for this exact phrasing. But basically, don‚Äôt do what you think the school or any group picks out to be the ideal path, for that sake.</p>
        <p class="content">This means don‚Äôt do things you don‚Äôt like to do for the sake of ticking a checkbox. For instance, the combination of good grades (which is important, yes), leadership positions in multiple areas, clocking many volunteer service hours‚Ä¶ So on, so forth. Perhaps it is because this combination is so numerous that makes it all the more important to deviate in a good way.</p>
        <p class="content">Imagine that there are 1 million students who have good grades, is a student leader, does XYZ in that order. Why should one be better than the other?</p>
        <p class="content">Find the things you really like and go deep. Forge your own path. This is something I am working on now. Don‚Äôt make the mistake of doing what seems popular just to tick a checkbox, because you won‚Äôt do it well and you won‚Äôt be well (happy) doing it.</p>
        <p class="content">This ties in closely to my next point‚Ä¶</p>
        <h2 class="content">7. Your principles matter more than what people think of you</h2>
        <p class="content">To avoid following what everyone else is doing for the sake of so, come up with overarching life principles. I did this exercise back in April 2023 and it has done wonders for keeping me consistent and on my path to success.</p>
        <p class="content">It really matters more to have a solid foundation in principles, rather than metrics outside of your control. This has to do with intrinsic and extrinsic motivations.</p>
        <p class="content">Ask yourself honestly: Where is my locus of control? Most people let their locus of control be wide, letting things they can‚Äôt control be the master of their self-worth.</p>
        <p class="content">I think it‚Äôs 10 times better to define ourselves by principles such as integrity, passion and grit over a 1.00 MSG.</p>
        <h2 class="content">8. Build a solid friend and support base, don‚Äôt focus on shallow metrics.</h2>
        <p class="content">To help in building these principles, finding your tribe is particularly important. I paid no heed to friends in lower secondary, focusing on the self.</p>
        <p class="content">But improving and building yourself is a lonely endeavour. Still, you can find homies, homeboys who can push you to rise up and help you when you‚Äôre at your lowest.</p>
        <p class="content">This really only became clear to me in 2023 when I was at a low point and less than 20/25 friends offered support and advice. It really is the Pareto principle in action. 20% of the people I knew, gave me 80% (maybe even 90%) of my happiness and growth.</p>
        <p class="content">I had found a friend group who shared some similarities with me, were supportive of my efforts to grow and fun to be around.</p>
        <p class="content">I would not give this up for vanity metrics like the number of followers one has on Instagram or ‚Äúpopularity‚Äù (which changes overnight).</p>
        <h2 class="content">9. Dedicate time outside to get CRAZY good at things. Cut past the red tape that is school. Avoid the middleman.</h2>
        <p class="content">One thing I am very particular about is pushing myself, outside of school. I have concluded that high school is a place full of red tape. It‚Äôs run like a bureaucracy, with the rulers leading from an ivory tower and absolutely no sense of reality of what it is like to be a student. Therefore I could not rely on the school to support me in my endeavours.</p>
        <p class="content">I have to break out, strive for success outside of school. Launch projects by yourself or with a friend. Make something of scale and positive value to society. I am working on several of these now and am excited to see where it takes me.</p>
        <h2 class="content">10. Focus on the long-term. Zoom out, keep your eyes on the prize.</h2>
        <p class="content">A final and overarching principle is to zoom out, always. That one bitchy loser who talks shit about you behind your back really doesn‚Äôt matter over a span of 2, 3 years.</p>
        <p class="content">So what‚Äôs your prize? Is it representing Singapore in the Olympics? Or, building a successful brand?</p>
      
        <p class="content">For me I have several such prizes which I use as my North star. Be ruthless: Does X get me closer to my long-term goals? If no, don‚Äôt do it. If yes, why the hell aren‚Äôt you doing it yet?</p>
        <p class="content">Wham. This took me an hour to pen down. But these 10 principles are the bedrock of my approach to high school. I wonder if you feel the same as me.</p>
