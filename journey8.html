        <h1 class="titlepost">Philsophy of Zeaus: A Handbook - I: Introduction</h1>
        <p style="color:grey" class="content" id="subtitle">By Zeaus Koh · 5 min read<br>4 September 2023</p>
        <h1 class="content">I. INTRODUCTION</h1>
        <p class="content">What are systems? Systems are a collection of mechanisms that work together in a specific context and are optimised to get certain tasks done. This is the easiest I can go, so let me illustrate with an example.</p>
        <p class="content">An example would be the education system. The education system has several mechanisms: standardised testing, streaming, hiring of teachers, and lessons. These mechanisms optimise for certain things, such as student grades, global rankings etc.</p>
        <p class="content">I focus on systems that control humans. There are systems that control air traffic, systems that control sewage, systems that control the Internet. That we are aware. Yet for myself, and for many others, we are blissfully and paradoxically unaware of how many systems are governing our lives.</p>
        <p class="content">We can call all these systems that influence our humanity The Matrix. The phrase has gotten a bad reputation, and rightfully so, because too many people who are still very much stuck in The Matrix claim to have escaped. These are pathetic role models, and if you idolise them, it will only be a matter of time before you become like them.</p>
        <p class="content">I am a victim of The Matrix. When I was born, I signed a social contract. So did you. We grow up in a not so delicate web of systems. It’s more brute-force and messy. And so, our internal state reflects this external chaos. We slowly began to see The Matrix as the status quo. It becomes comfortable, all you’ve ever known and may only know. Granted, there are some born in the highest realms of the elite, being exposed to unimaginable wealth from young. For them, they contend with another set of systems: useless and obnoxious cocktail parties, one-upping other wealthy people, drugs, organised crime etc.</p>
        <p class="content">The point is: At the beginning of anyone’s journey, you are already in The Matrix. This isn’t some predefined constructed ecosystem that binds everyone alike. That may be cool but it’s not true. In reality we all have our own Matrix, that’s different from people of other contexts. So the journey involves:</p>
        <ol class="content">
          <li>recognition that you are in a Matrix,</li>
          <li>identifying systems you would like to extract yourself out of,</li>
          <li>shedding the current you,</li>
          <li>setting a North Star,</li>
          <li>building yourself back up,</li>
          <li>building systems to get to where your North Star is,</li>
          <li>and repeat steps 3 - 6 continually.</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="content">One of the influencers I used to follow is a model and extreme sportsman, Jay Alvarrez (I found him through Instagram last year but since I’ve quit IG, I must note that I haven’t heard from him since 2022), and he sums it up perfectly in this quote. It has since become my mantra:</p>
        <p class="content">It takes a dangerous mind to want more in this world. You have to resist. Every pull. Every push. Every pressure to be normal. Dangerous minds enjoy it. Stress is peace. Chaos is fuel. Life becomes a game of doing the impossible. And to play, you shed the current version of yourself. Over and over. Most can’t handle these regular little deaths. You dance on the line between genius and madness. And you realise, all that matters, is making the dance last forever.</p>
        <p class="content">Having read this far, this quote may irk you. If and when it does, you will have to do some introspection. Becoming a GREAT, EXTRAORDINARY MAN is not something all men can do. That is why there are billions of humans, dead and alive. But only a handful of names everyone knows. These are great men. Their legacy outlives them. But there are so few of them. Because not everybody can go through what it takes to become them.</p>
        <p class="content">I started this Handbook of sorts, The Philosophy of Zeaus, because I wanted to break out of my mediocrity. I wanted to break out of my own Matrix. Of course, starting a handbook isn’t going to break me out of my Matrix. But I intend to consolidate the learnings and key insights on my journey here. The writings here are extracted from briefer notes on my Telegram channel (I use it as a more versatile journal) and my website. I also journal pretty regularly on a Notion.</p>
        <p class="content">Before we begin, the jargon we’re using:</p>
        <ul class="content">
          <li>The Matrix = a set of systems that control and influence your thought and actions</li>
          <li>The Journey = the only self improvement process, it involves recognition, identification, breaking yourself down, setting a North Star, building yourself up, building your systems and getting there, and repeat</li>
          <li>Slaves = average people who are an unwitting subject of the Matrix, they are usually (but not always) mediocre and unhappy (but can be ignorantly happy)</li>
          <li>Great Men = the people who’ve successfully accomplished the Journey. They are successful by conventional measures (rich, smart, good-looking, healthy, popular, reputable) but live life on their own terms and are thus happier</li>
          <li>Extraordinary Men = these are Great Men who live the Journey, they "dance the lines between genius and madness and for them it goes on forever". They’re at such a level, almost godlike, to slaves</li>
          <li>Traveller = People like me and you. We are embarking on our own Journeys, but we are not there at the end yet</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="content">Great, so we’ll use these definitions throughout the handbook, so get used to it. It’s my own personal narrative, but if it resonates with you? Go for it.</p>
        <p class="content">I thought I started my Self Improvement in December 2022, after a major setback enabled a newfound clarity of mind.</p>
        <p class="content">I was wrong. It wasn’t clarity, it was bitterness that ensnared me.</p>
        <p class="content">So for months I was paddling aimlessly.</p>
        <p class="content">Somewhere around May-June 2023, I began reading again. I read voraciously. I chanced upon several good writers and thinkers: Naval Ravikant, Cal Newport, Tim Ferris, Sam Altman, Paul Graham, David Goggins and Patrick Collison. They gave me a new perspective and by the time I’ve been able to rid myself of the cloud that fogged my vision.</p>
        <p class="content">It was then that I would begin my Journey. Alas from June to August I was focused on specific things, I haven’t achieved big-picture clarity yet. Now I can say I have.</p>
        <p class="content">I’ve also been able to sit down and step back and reassess. It was then I crafted this narrative, and I believe it is a very good model of looking at self improvement.</p>
        <p class="content">This is an exciting stepping stone in my self improvement, I’m excited to begin.</p>
