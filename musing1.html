        <h1 class="titlepost">Mimetic Desires</h1>
        <p style="color:grey" class="content" id="subtitle">By Zeaus Koh Â· 3 min read<br>20 June 2023</p>
        <p class="content">Mimetic Desires is this new concept i found out from Sigil Wen on his <a href="https://sigilwen.ca/exceptional.html" target="_blank">website</a>. good stuff i highly recommend you check him out. anyways mimetic desires is a theory by Rene Girard, a French philosopher. The idea is that when you are in a group of people (and humans are almost always in a group e.g. school, work, friends, family), your tastes and inclinations and psyche slowly becomes similar to those around you.</p>
        <p class="content">for example, if you go to school everyday surrounded by people who actively DESIRE good grades, and want to get say an A1, you are <strong>more</strong> likely to want the same thing. even if originally the kind of student who just frankly does not care much about grades... but because of your social conditioning, you eventually want it. and i think this works on a subconscious level more than a conscious level.</p>
        <p class="content">and this is both a revelation and a source of great concern because it means that a lot of the things we want, and thus the goals we set, are not really what we want; and it also means that the people in your life have a far BIGGER influence on you than you think. this is a revelation, because now that i understand this concept, i can actively take steps to reflect on my desires and goals, and make sure they are really in line with who i am and am working to become. it is scary because it forces me to look very closely at the people in my life and ask: "Are these people really a good influence?"</p>
        <p class="content">i will take some active steps but here are some of my general thoughts after considering mimetic desires on a deeper level:</p>
        <ul class="content">
            <li>there are several people in my life who I consider good influences. people i genuinely want to be with. most of the people i am acquaintances with i don't want to be influenced by. i have done a decent job at prioritising the people who are a good influence. shoutout to: Lyn (she's got a great work ethic and i've talked to her a lot more recently), JTee (ur such a wise friend and ur wisdom is beyond years i feel like ur a 50 year old man), Celestine (i dont even need to explain), Yi Tao (u give me real talk), Ryan (i dont always agree with you, but you have a pretty good work ethic plus we both love science), yiwei, yuheng, the list goes on...</li>
            <li>there are also A LOT of people i dont want to be influenced by; these people are either pessimistic (these are poisononous and their beliefs are self-fulfilling), aimless, NPCs (EXACTLY what i mean by mimetic desires and sheep mentality), unprincipled, boring (ok this is very biased but its true im working to surround myself with interesting and COOL people, people who do cool s**t and can hold deep and different ideas and have disagreements with)...</li>
            <li>i need to ensure the people i surround myself with are genuinely good influences i.e. if im surrounded by 5 high-performing people who do great stuff and work on themselves, i feel that grit and desire for the same</li>
            <li>cut out the bad people, ruthlessly; I think Naval Ravikant shared some good insights on this somewhere in the Navalmanack</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="content">another great resource i found about how to OVERCOME this mimetic truth is <a href="https://luke.medium.com/25-anti-mimetic-tactics-for-living-a-counter-cultural-life-87be1c5b2622" target="_blank">this Medium article</a>, some general insights for myself to come back and refer to</p>
        <ul class="content">
            <li>expose yourself to content you DISAGREE with i.e. read all sorts of media (caveat: avoid politics at all costs, unproductive)</li>
            <li>return anger with kindness, which is counterfactual to most humans and thus anti-mimetic</li>
            <li>seek positive mimesis i.e. what im doing already</li>
            <li>cultivate an interdisciplinary mind, which is personally quite fun for me cos i like to go deep in the oddest of subjects (hey hey i recently went DEEP into oncology and cancer research, iykyk)</li>
            <li>become an autodidact i.e. teach yourself, don't just go to school and pretend you're learned because you're just gonna get outcompeted by someone who both went to school AND taught himself</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="content">that's pretty much all for this post. i'm gonna be taking a backseat to focus on some cool AI project i'm doing (will share more when my MVP is out and when i'm tryna onboard my first 100 users)... cheers</p>
