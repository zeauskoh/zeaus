        <h1 class="titlepost">Breakthrough Science Challenge: A video about Cancer</h1>
        <p style="color:grey" class="content" id="subtitle">By Zeaus Koh Â· 9/10<br>25 June 2023</p>
        <p class="content">tldr; i studied oncology, planned a video, scripted it, filmed it twice and edited a 2 minute explainer video on what cancer really is in a week. was an absolute rush and also very mind-bending, so I rate it a 9/10 project. i'm inspired to create a Science Youtube channel with a friend, will probably start releasing videos after October 2023.</p>
        <p class="content">the video can be found <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nDHJ_fKTU4">here on YouTube</a>, do drop a Subscribe and like. also let me know your comments personally so i know how to improve for subsequent video projects.</p>
        <p class="content">the thing about making science explainers is that it takes a lot more effort than it seems i.e. deceptively easy. you gotta understand every little detail about your subject/topic, then sift through all that to pick out the main ideas, then package it in an easy, engaging way. i'm using this method to prepare for my Science subjects, heard it's called Feynman's method or something. might film some videos with a bunch of friends before EOYs and then come back to it after October 2023, aiming for 5k subs before end of year? totally doable.</p>
