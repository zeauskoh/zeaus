        <h1 class="titlepost">Habits pt. 2: Building Good Habits</h1>
        <p style="color:grey" class="content" id="subtitle">By Zeaus Koh · 5 min read<br>24 July 2023</p>
        <p class="content">The good habits and practices I will implement.</p>
        <h2 class="content">Goody 1: Consistent sleep schedule</h2>
        <p class="content">I think a key part of a good health system is consistent sleep. I have first hand witnessed the benefits of good sleep, especially when I used to pull ⅘-hour nights for about two months in Secondary 2.</p>
        <p class="content">But now I find my sleep schedule getting awry, because life is not entirely predictable. And I find myself making excuses for sleeping just a bit later.</p>
        <p class="content">No more. Right now I’m at a stage where I’m focused on growth. This particular term the sub focus is on INTENSITY. So I will be working on these habits as well as my <a href="./journey6.html">bad habits</a> with great intensity.</p>
        <p class="content">Action to Take:</p>
        <ul class="content">
        <li>Sleep at 930 pm every night, regardless of weekdays/weekends. On weekdays, I wake up at 630 am (9 hours). On weekends, I will wake up at 830 am (11 hours).</li>
        <li>Use the <a href="https://www.tomsguide.com/how-to/how-to-use-the-10-3-2-1-0-sleep-rule-for-better-slumber-tonight" target="_blank">10-3-2-1 rule</a>. 10 hours before bed, no caffeine, although I don’t take caffeine so this doesn’t really apply. 3 hours before bed, no more food. 2 hours before bed, no more fluids. 1 hour before bed, no more devices.</li>
        <li>Specifically, my MHHH (wind-down routine) begins at 9 pm sharp (more on that later). But I will shut down all devices by 830 pm.</li>
        <li>No light, block off all sources of light. Hit the bed by 930 pm, no excuses.</li>
        <li>If there’s overdue work, quit it and work on it the next day. This isn’t procrastination, it’s discipline. Because if you’re really disciplined, you wouldn’t have overdue work.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2 class="content">Goody 2: Healthy meals, no processed food</h2>
        <p class="content">I generally hold my diet to a high standard, as I’ve suffered from eating problems for quite some time before. However, I occasionally slack off on this high standard, be it due to peer pressure or inability to control my desires.</p>
        <p class="content">Action to Take:</p>
        <ul class="content">
        <li>Simplify and reduce friction in my decision making process. For meals in school, only go to the 菜贩 or Rice Bowl stalls, because they allow for carbs + protein + egg + fibre. When I’m outside, only buy foods that allow for this particular combo. Fast food is a NO NO. Fuck you McDonalds.</li>
        <li>Don’t eat anything that comes in a package. That’s how to avoid processed food. (NB: Yes I know fruits sometimes come in a plastic bag but for the most part you can just take the fruits out of the fruit shelf without them being wrapped.)</li>
        <li>When confronted with unhealthy desires, substitute for a cup of milk and/or fruit.</li>
        <li>Drink 3-4 cups of milk per day.</li>
        <li>Ideally I’d be eating a Paleo Diet, but I’ll leave that for when I’m fully grown. For now, I’ll stick to a breakfast-lunch-dinner-fruits plan.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2 class="content">Goody 3: Mental health half hour</h2>
        <p class="content">The rationale for this is because mental wellbeing is more important than I thought. Being well enables me to achieve new heights of success and allows me to focus on what really matters.</p>
        <p class="content">This is particularly because as teens in this age, our lives are noisy. The moment we wake up to the alarm clock to turn out the lights at night we’re constantly being stimulated. Such stimuli include: Parents shouting at you. Notifications from social media (glad I got rid of that one). Work. Street noise. Horrible smells (whether from a classmate or a sewer).</p>
        <p class="content">The MHHH is a system I’ll implement to reduce stimuli to near 0 and build a strong headspace.</p>
        <p class="content">Action to Take:</p>
        <ul class="content">
        <li>The MHHH will be from 9 pm to 930 pm daily, except for Fridays as I come home late (so on Fridays it will be from 10 pm to 1030 pm).</li>
        <li>Before I start I should have washed up and essentially gotten ready for bed.</li>
        <li>It will consist of five components: reviewing my planner; journaling; reading; stretching and meditation.</li>
        <li>Reviewing my planner and calendar [5 mins] = Tick off all the tasks I’ve done and set goals for the next day. Transfer major events to my wall calendar and update the taskboard. Finally, tick the day with a BIG GREEN CHECK if today I lived by my principles and carried out the habits I have set for myself. I would want the chain to continue.</li>
        <li>Journalling [5 mins] = I have created and curated a special journaling format that can be done everyday quickly on Notion. It basically includes reflection, insights and gratitude.</li>
        <li>Reading [10 mins] = Reading a hardcopy book. I saved my EBooks for earlier in the day, so it’s time for me to invest in buying hardcopy books. Robert Greene here I COMEEEEE!</li>
        <li>Stretching [5 mins] = I do simple yoga to elongate my spine and relax my nervous system.</li>
        <li>Meditation [5 mins] = Using Medito, last step before bed.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2 class="content">Goody 4: Daily reading, weekly reading</h2>
        <p class="content">All my heroes read a lot. Obama read an hour a day while he was POTUS. Bill Gates finishes one book a week. Elon Musk is a voracious reader. I need to cultivate a more consistent reading habit.</p>
        <p class="content">Action to Take:</p>
        <ul class="content">
        <li>My goals are at least a half hour of reading a day, as well as completing a book a week. So in one year, I’d have completed 52 books. That’s crazy.</li>
        <li>Reading during skillset construction hours is permitted. But I’ll also read whenever I can: on the bus, on the train, while queuing etc. Just don’t read during important lessons.</li>
        <li>Finish a book a week. So a normal book is about 1000 pages. So one day I should read about 150 pages. For me, that would be about an hour of reading per day.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2 class="content">Goody 5: Make 110% a norm</h2>
        <p class="content">This is meant to address my work ethic.</p> 
        <p class="content">Action to Take:</p>
        <ul class="content">
        <li>Translate every prescribed goal into a 110% better one. For example, if Mom says do the dishes, I translate it to “do the dishes and clean the table”. If Mrs Goh says finish the worksheet by next Friday, I translate to “do two worksheets by next Monday”.</li>
        <li>This way, it won’t feel like I’m doing extra, but I’m actually punching above my weight.</li>
        <li>Using that system in all areas of my life will allow me to 5x my growth.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2 class="content">Goody 6: Set aside a work mechanism</h2>
        <p class="content">Basically, how do I plan my time?</p>
        <p class="content">Action to Take:</p>
        <ul class="content">
        <li>Update daily planner when tasks are given (bearing in mind the 110% rule). Assign deadlines.</li>
        <li>Update Google Calendar for events, meetings and projects, as and when. Check it through at night during MHHH.</li>
        <li>Always tick when the day would be a good day i.e. I lived by my principles and followed my plan. Create a chain and don’t break it.</li>
        <li>Every Sunday morning after my workout, set aside 30 mins to plan the next week. Assign tasks, create events on Google Calendar and transcribe onto the wall calendar. Set reminders and important ideas on my whiteboard (task board).</li>
        </ul>
        <h2 class="content">Goody 7: Skill set construction hour</h2>
        <p class="content">Every night, from 8 pm to 9 pm, will be designated as my skill set construction hour. If there’s an important exam and/or project to be done, I can use this time.</p>
        <p class="content">Action to Take:</p>
        <ul class="content">
        <li>Focus on my spikes and passions.</li>
        <li>Read, research, watch videos, get inspired. Transfer all the resources into my Growth Notion database.</li>
        </ul>
        <hr>
        <p class="content">These are all the habits I am looking to implement now. INTENSITY!!!</p>
