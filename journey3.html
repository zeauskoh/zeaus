        <h1 class="titlepost">Goals for Q3 of 2023!</h1>
        <p style="color:grey" class="content" id="subtitle">By Zeaus Koh · 2 min read<br>27 June 2023</p>
        <p class="content">i am taking a break from 高级华文 revision to write this and share it with my homies to keep myself accountable. bois, if you have any suggested goals / fresh ideas on steps i can take, text me plss :P</p>
        <p class="content">in summary, my Q3 of 2023 involves seven key goals:</p>
        <ol class="content">
            <li>Build a world-class skillset that increases my options (inspired by Paul Graham's <a href="http://paulgraham.com/hs.html" target="_blank">What You Wish You'd Known in High School</a></li>
            <li>Tear down my old mental model of Life and Myself, Build a <strong>growth</strong> mindset and a mental model that supercharges my self improvement journey</li>
            <li>Build cool s**t i.e. work on passion projects in areas that interest me (right now: AI, webdev, quantum computing) and build LEVERAGE using code and product</li>
            <li>Work on my existing key 6 principles I want to lead my life by (AFI: i need to be more consistent with this)</li>
            <li>Build my knowledge -- both in academics in school (studying is a way for me to build knowledge) and outside via autodidactism</li>
            <li>Build a solid, trusty circle of friends, mentors and supporters who give me the hard truths, challenge each other to become better and are genuinely interesting to have deep convos with</li>
            <li>Build my physicality (remember: physical appearance isn't cast in stone. don't fall for the fixed mindset!). Want to get leaner? work the fuck out. Want to grow taller? sleep more, drink more milk, work out more. Want to get better at agility/stamina for my sports? the answer is literally obvious.</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="content">for the 1st goal, I am looking at upgrading my webdev skills to become a full stack developer. this means the basics (html, css, js) and the advanced (python). apply these skills to launch one of my AI projects by building the interface. on top of that, continue learning about Rationality, understanding how to build and update beliefs about the world. learn Quantum Computing. learn videography + editing + design (become an adobe wizard!). learn personal finance, understand how to invest and grow my assets and personal wealth.</p>
        <p class="content">for the 2nd goal, I will build a GROWTH mindset (as inspired by Dr Carol Dweck). i generally lean more towards the Growth end of the Growth-Fixed spectrum, but some big setbacks can throw me off to the fixed side. so I want to fundamentally change my mental models, to find joy in the struggle and to cultivate an interest for the difficult.</p>
        <p class="content">for the 3rd goal, I will work on some projects I've been prepping for for a while now... This includes AI and quantum computing, as well as my coral research at REL. for the former, i'm aiming to launch by September (August if i'm early). generally, find things that interest me, go deep, build, fail, try again, seek advice, and build LEVERAGE. thanks naval ravikant.</p>
        <p class="content">for the 4th goal, I want to continue working on my core principles. I've decided and settled on a major 6 (each have sub qualities I strive to emulate) and it's time to rly be serious about it. draw the line between being influenced by peer pressure (esp when these peers don't have the core values i'm looking at) and actively building myself into who i want to be. remember, personality + quality can be changed!</p>
        <p class="content">for the 5th goal, I want to build my knowledge base. this isn't hard for me because deep, obssessive and hardcore learning has always been my thing. but i am aiming for a renewed focus on academics (i see value in some subjects -- namely maths, chinese, the sciences, econs etc.; not social studies tho) and actively trying to push myself there. and also on areas that the curriculum is too slow to teach. I am gonna become an expert by end of Q3 on blockchain and NFTs, marine biodiversity, Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (either there's a lot of nuance i'm missing out on, or it's rly as easy as what i've gleaned over on CBT textbooks), Bayesian statistics and reasoning...</p>
        <p class="content">for the 6th goal, I want to apply the Pareto principle. 80/20 rule. 20% of the people I know in school and in my social life bring 80% of net positive benefits to me (happiness, push to excel). i want to focus on these relationships and find more such friendships. i want to spend more time with da bois, with my bestfriend (ily jaden no homo), my sis. and find more intereting, uplifting people -- be it through serendipity or by working on my passion projects and generating leverage.</p>
        <p class="content">for the 7th goal, I want to build my physical body. master this and i will transcend my current form like pokemon. wtf. but mind over body. nothing's cast in stone. a very physically fit person now could become a fat, out of shape loser in months. similarly, from where i am now, if i work on myself every day, there's a high probability (again, i'm aware of the statistical likelihood of DRASTIC change) of good physical growth that would make me proud.</p>
        <p class="content">that's all bois. hope you can support me on this journey. give me feedback when i'm not at mt 110% on any of these goals. and up!</p>
