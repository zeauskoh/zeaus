        <h1 class="titlepost">Why are there bad leaders?</h1>
        <p style="color:grey" class="content" id="subtitle">By Zeaus Koh · 5 min read<br>15 July 2023</p>
        <p class="content">My high school is supposed to be one of the top ranked schools in Singapore. Perhaps it seems so from the outside. But inside, I just don’t see it. I remember talking to lots of staff in my school. These people are dedicated, good at their jobs and intelligent. Many of them tell of larger institutional problems that plague the entire school.</p>
        <p class="content">But of course, we need to be objective. So let’s look at the facts. In summary, I observed:</p>
        <ul class="content">
          <li class="content">troves of good educators leaving, some not even at the retirement age</li>
          <li class="content">a suicide incident that was 1) suppressed by the management, 2) no official message to the public, and 3) no official talk given by the school leaders to students about the incident</li>
          <li class="content">the academic rankings of the school has <a href="https://schoolbell.sg/secondary-school-ranking/" target="_blank">dropped</a></li>
          <li class="content">no innovative educational initiatives being launched in 4 years (ironic for a school that prides itself on an independent programme)</li>
          <li class="content">hiring of many teachers from the Education Ministry instead of directly sourcing teachers who may be more qualified (NB: the MOE teachers leave after 2 or 3 years and thus don’t have a strong belonging to the school)</li>
          <li class="content">many school events, that students like myself were planning, were restricted/cancelled/postponed because of the school leaders</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="content">Now some of the things I have heard from staff, make of it what you will:</p>
        <ul class="content">
          <li class="content">many teachers are indeed retiring in droves</li>
          <li class="content">there was a Climate Survey conducted by the School Management to ascertain all staff’s thoughts about the management, however the Principal chose not to share the results, which was contrary to the expected procedure (again, make of it what you will)</li>
          <li class="content">there is an increasing divide between direct hire teachers and teachers brought in from MOE</li>
          <li class="content">every major initiative has to be approved by those at the top</li>
          <li class="content">it is very hierarchical</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="content">Many of the observations and sharings from people I know reflect a broken leadership approach, that either lost touch with reality, or sees the reality and refuses to acknowledge it.</p>
        <p class="content">These problems arise when leaders think only of their reputation and for their self-interest. The organisation they lead is a platform for them to shine, not to fulfil the organisation’s missions (that is only secondary). Leaders who choose to suppress major problems instead of open, transparent conversations, for whatever reason, are in my opinion, cowards. Using a position of authority to shove something under the carpet is hideously shameful. I wonder how people can do that and sleep at night, but the world has plenty of them. I wonder if in another context (e.g. another country), would a student suicide been shoved under the carpet? Maybe not.</p>
        <p class="content">That’s the context behind why I raised this question. Why are there bad leaders?</p>
        <p class="content">It begins from first principles. What exactly defines a leader? No, not the principles you want to see in your boss. Of course we’d love an open, charismatic, honest and foresighted leader. But all a leader is someone granted higher levels of power to direct a group of people and an organisation.</p>
        <p class="content">Power isn’t dirty. I don’t think power is inherently bad. It depends on the person who wields it. Power grants leaders the ability to initiate projects that may not be popular and effectively tap on followers’ potential to create change (positive or negative).</p>
        <p class="content">I’ve been thinking about this question in the back of my mind for a while now. Here are some hypotheses I have, feel free to disagree I’d love a discussion:</p>
        <h2 class="content">1. Bad leaders don’t get bad instantly, some deteriorate the moment they come into power</h2>
        <p class="content">There are two definitions of bad. One is you’re morally bankrupt. Two is you’re just horrible or mediocre at what you do. Let’s focus on the second one.</p>
        <p class="content">Some people may display an aptitude for leadership, but, who can judge this? You can make predictions about whether someone will be a good leader, but you don't know for certain. Maybe everything you’ve observed about someone was a facade, a Robert Greene 48 Laws of Power kind of method. Or maybe they are better at leading small teams, not big organisations.</p>
        <p class="content">When you elevate these people to positions of power, they don’t instantly become bad. Their flaws and mental biases just show over time. If we look at my school leader, when I read about him entering the position in 2019, everyone seemed to think he was a good fit. He seemed a pleasant fellow.</p>
        <p class="content">And look how wrong we were, 5 years into his tenure and the institution is on the road down. What happened?</p>
        <p class="content">That would bring me to my next few points, which may be possible reasons why a leader becomes bad.</p>
        <h2 class="content">2. Bad leaders prioritise self-interest over the good of those they lead</h2>
        <p class="content">Bad leaders are selfish. Their ego is big, and often, fragile. So they define themselves very deeply by their reputation and their relative position in life.</p>
        <p class="content">For such people, all that matters is going up, or if they can’t, maintaining their position. Trivial things like the welfare of their followers and the mission of the organisation they lead just isn’t a variable in their equations.</p>
        <p class="content">Anything that makes them look good, they’ll do and take credit for it. Anything that may even make them look slightly bad, they’ll remove, hide, shun and suppress.</p>
        <p class="content">It therefore depends on the leader’s mindset. It’s never black and white, but if a leader only focuses on his self interest, the plans he implements would never prioritise the people he leads.</p>
        <h2 class="content">3. Bad leaders lead from an ivory tower</h2>
        <p class="content">Another reason why leaders become bad is because they lose touch with the ground. This is most acute for big organisations with many levels of hierarchy.</p>
        <p class="content">My leadership style is to have a very flat organisation structure with one recognised lead but with psychological safety. This means people can feel free to question, criticise and make suggestions without feeling that their chances of promotion are discriminated against.</p>
        <p class="content">A large organisation will slowly create many levels of hierarchy, bureaucracy and widening the gap from the bottom and the top. If leaders don’t know what’s going on in the organisation, how are they going to lead well? They’d just be deluding themselves. Their ideas will either be too idealistic or too stupid.</p>
        <p class="content">The other connotation of ivory tower suggests isolation. Leaders who are not transparent, who hide behind their authority, will be afraid to hear what most followers think of them, because it’s probably negative. Take a Climate Survey for example. If you hide the responses, what does it show? To me, it suggests that the results weren’t in favour of you and that you’re a coward.</p>
        <p class="content">For a school, the very bottom would be the students. But yet that is what schools exist to serve and educate. I can imagine my school leader can’t name more than three students and their class and CCA. Heck, if he can do even one, I’ll be surprised. On the flipside, teachers know a lot more about the students they teach. They know what these students struggle in, and need help in. For such teachers I can imagine how frustrating it is when the school leaders come up with plans that just miss the target entirely, that fail to solve the root problem and help students.</p>
        <h2 class="content">4. Bad leaders are just incompetent and were never right for the job</h2>
        <p class="content">Lastly, bad leaders could just be hopelessly incompetent. They’re probably not the right fit for the leadership position anyways. The responsibility then lies on who elected or nominated them to that position.</p>
        <p class="content">And the thing is, leadership isn’t something you can learn in a course, albeit there are many courses which will try to teach leadership. There’s no Bachelor’s degree in Leadership. Leadership is a collection of skills, values and knowledge, and is unique to each domain. A good Big Tech CEO may not necessarily make a good Prime Minister. </p>
        <p class="content">So the problem comes down to how do we measure leadership potential: How do we know who will make a good leader?</p>
        <p class="content">I would start from values. If the candidate does not have a good moral compass, he will not make a good leader. Excellent people get excellent results. Bad people get bad results. That’s all there is. Make sure the leader is honest, diligent, creative and humble. That is something many leaders don’t even have.</p>
        <br class="content">
        <p class="content">Well, so now we have it, this is why there are bad leaders. But often, as is the case in my school, the good teachers are fish swimming upstream. The entire school system is coming undone, and the rare gems are leaving the school for good. After all, the leadership selection process is not unthorough. It could rather point to a larger, deeper problem within the entire educational system.</p>
        <p class="content">So where does this leave us, students? I always tell myself this. For any problem or thing you dislike (be it about the external environment or yourself), you only have two choices: change it or accept it. There’s no such thing as rumination. If you can’t accept it, if you don’t want to accept it, then change it. Do something. But if you’re okay with the status quo, if you are able to ensure a good education and development of yourself in spite of how bad a school you go to, then accept the school for what it is.</p>
        <p class="content">And, don’t become a bad leader.</p>
