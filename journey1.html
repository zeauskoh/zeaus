        <h1 class="titlepost">A macro look back on life thus far</h1>
        <p style="color:grey">By Zeaus Koh Â· x min read<br>18 June 2023</p>
        <p class="content">i am a firm believer in <strong>rationality</strong> as a thought practice. and part of being rational is about overcoming biases and updating beliefs which in turns construct our map of the world. and in any self-improvement journey, or growth, i think i need to return to the past: identify key mistakes, biases, actions that culminated in x/y/z to then decide how I want to go about building myself.</p>
        <p class="content">so the context behind why I want to embark on such a self-improvement journey</p>
        <li class="content">
            <ul>i enjoy growth: idk how else to put this but i genuinely enjoy looking back at myself a week/month/year ago and saying "dam that guy was so stupid or immature or selfish" and then acknowledging "i've actively made an improvement from that point" :)</ul>
            <ul>i want to join the ranks of the Great, in this case the people who have made large-scale, positive impact and demonstrated an admirable philosophy in their life that people just instinctively link it to said people e.g. the Zeaus way of life</ul>
            <ul>i can SEE my flaws, like no cap even if my friends (shoutout to ryan) think im dam immature, i do actually see those character flaws and now that i SEE them, i simply find it absurd to continue the status quo</ul>
        </li>
        <p class="content">so now that that's aside, i'm going to take a quick walk down memory lane, to sorta understand my past a little bit better and for my friends ya this is my journey so far</p>
        <li class="content">
            <ol>my baby years: i have mixed blood which is why i look like an American baby but i grew out of it (my friends like to tell me i didn't) and i also met my sis Celestine</ol>
            <ol>infancy: as a toddler my mum and dad were very focused on education and making me a smart baby and i was watching all the educational baby content on TV but they rarely let me use a screen instead it was always lego or duplo or picture books</ol>
            <ol>in Halifax (that was my kindergarten days) i met my childhood friends: s, e, b and we're still bros to this day</ol>
            <ol>from what i recall i love to create in-groups and lead them during playtime and stuff -- i guess i always had that natural tendency to lead</ol>
            <ol>then primary school was a breeze from p1 to p3, like my grandpa always had a hard time making me sit down and study BUT for some reason i always got top of the class</ol>
            <ol>at this point in time everyone ik started calling me 'gifted' and 'smart' and if you know about <a href="https://medium.com/illumination/why-being-gifted-can-be-a-curse-5c607c899616" target="_blank">the curse of the gifted child</a> ya that pretty much happened to me</ol>
            <ol>i got into the gifted prog at 10 years old and that was when a) i found ppl i genuinely vibed with b) i was seriously outcompeted (in my defence 60% of my gifted cohort all went to tuition and classes to get in, my mum didnt even know gifted was a thing -- which makes me question her parenting sometimes)</ol>
            <ol>i met some cool people, learnt a LOT more than i would have in a normal class, also i went thru a lot of character change all the way till PSLE</ol>
            <ol>i got into Hwa Chong! was rly excited in s1 and s2 i was top of class top of cohort model studet and i grinded a lot of accolades; went down the model student path</ol>
            <ol>also did well in extracurriculars got into student council became vice chair yada yada</ol>
            <ol>around end of sec 3 (2022) when i was 15 i got rejected from the council and that jus threw me off because up till then my path was pretty smooth and comfortable</ol>
        </li>
        <p class="content">and yea that's a macro look back so far... so already i have some personal takes on my journey. for my friends reading this pls pls pls whatsapp/vid call me/tag me in the grp chat and share ur thoughts i wanna hear more perspectives</p>
        <p class="content">for one i think of what Paul Graham wrote in <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/lesson.html" target="_blank">his blog</a> which speaks to my challenges so far. i.e. i was so focused on grades and hacking bad tests that i completely forgot the point. in other words, i <a href="https://danmackinlay.name/notebook/goodharts_law.html" target="_blank">Goodharted</a> myself and a lot of my peers do too, which is not their fault the system sorts of create a pressure towards such Goodharting behaviourr</p>
        <p class="content">two i never really thought about my long-term goals, iykyk, and i realised a lot of the effort and time i had was spent on being a good student but like bruh singaporeans are still generally underrepresented on the global stage and most of my seniors who graduate only a few are real interesting cool material, the rest are all standard cookies</p>
        <p class="content">three i didn't like it?? there are certain things i love - science, tech, building things, my focus, creating content - which a lot of the joy i get from genuine learning and NOT grinding for a test, so now its time to think about how I can actually do this stuff and get good and make a name for myself and create impact which IRONICALLY my school is a horrible environment for that</p>
        <p>so i have a few goals for myself for the coming few weeks, months till JC, at that point i should have achieved these goals, and then at that point i'll decide how i can 10x my growth again</p>
        <li class="content">
            <ul>Build a world class skillset (this was inspired by this rly cool asian-canadian i found out about thru twitter, his name is sigil wen i rly want to meet him one day)</ul>
            <ul>Build good principles and a high character and become a great human and to never let anybody steer me away from my principles</ul>
            <ul>Build cool things, work on my crazy radical stupid bombastic projects, fail oftenn, laugh it off, try again, and scale my impact</ul>
            <ul>Build my knowledge, become a polymath, master school (i.e. make the best of it since i prolly wont drop out like Thield F. wants) and continue to deepen my learning OUTSIDE of school</ul>
        </li>
        <p class="content">yea that's it i dump my progress on a private telegram channel (i will post summaries on this website but when im busy the tele channel is rly conv) and if ur reading this means i trust u enough u can ask me if you wanna join my journey to GREATNESS leggo boisss</p>
